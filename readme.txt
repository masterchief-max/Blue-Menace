hello my friends ,
this c++ program / code is the port of my first and my most popular repo "midnight-chaser"
i made this repo to learn c++ along side python
this repo is for beginners looking to learn c++ by making something interesting , short and rewarding
this game is quite simple you just have to avoid a damn circle chasing you it s controls are w/a/s/d
and i am a beginner and a 13 year old so this code may have bugs and improvements and features are always welcome.
